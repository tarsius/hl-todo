** Highlight TODO and similar keywords in comments and strings

To highlight keywords turn on ~hl-todo-mode~ in individual buffers
or use the global variant ~global-hl-todo-mode~.

You can customize the keywords that are recognized by customizing
~hl-todo-keyword-faces~ either through the customization interface
or by setting the variable directly in your init file, for example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq hl-todo-keyword-faces
	'(("TODO"   . "#FF0000")
	  ("FIXME"  . "#FF0000")
	  ("DEBUG"  . "#A020F0")
	  ("GOTCHA" . "#FF4500")
	  ("STUB"   . "#1E90FF")))
#+end_src

This package also provides commands for moving to the next or
previous keyword, to invoke ~occur~ with a regexp that matches all
known keywords, and to insert a keyword.  If you want to use these
commands, then you should bind them in ~hl-todo-mode-map~, e.g.:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key hl-todo-mode-map (kbd "C-c p") 'hl-todo-previous)
  (define-key hl-todo-mode-map (kbd "C-c n") 'hl-todo-next)
  (define-key hl-todo-mode-map (kbd "C-c o") 'hl-todo-occur)
  (define-key hl-todo-mode-map (kbd "C-c i") 'hl-todo-insert)
#+end_src

See [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FixmeMode][this list]] on the Emacswiki for other packages that implement
the same basic features, but which might also provide additional
features that you might like, but which I don't deem necessary.

See [[https://github.com/tarsius/hl-todo/wiki][FAQ and Common Issues]] if something isn't working as expected.
